/* simple web manage emoployee's data developed with react.js, python django and postgresql */

You can run font-end on http://localhost:3000 or also by adding /api/employees

There are two ways to run back-end. These are http://127.0.0.1:8000/employees and http://localhost:8000/api/employees/
The First one is web page with my own UI and second one is Django REST framework

run command : 
- npm start (finalprojectfront)
- python3 manage.py runserver (FinalProjectBack)
